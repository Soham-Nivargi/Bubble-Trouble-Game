In the game,the bubbles on the screen which are continuously moving have to be shot down with bullets coming out of the shooter present at the bottom of the screen. 
There are 3 levels in the game with increasing difficulty.
Basic Instructions:
To shoot - press 'w'
To move left - press 'a'
To move right - press 'd'
To exit game - press 'q'

If the bubble hits the shooter,one life(health) of the shooter is lost and the bubble is respawned again at a neutral position.
The player has to eliminate all the bubbles in a level in the specified time limit, without losing all his lives(health) provided in the level.
There are three types of bubbles for each level,namely small(S),medium(M),large(L).
If the large bubble is hit,it converts into 2 medium bubbles and similarly,medium converts into 2 small bubbles with increased velocity. 
Whereas the small bubble disappears after getting hit.
For level 1,the player has 1 life(health) and time provided on the timer is 20 starting with 2 small bubbles.
For level 2,the player has 3 lives(health) and time provided on the timer is 30 starting with 2 medium bubbles.
For level 3,the player has 5 lives(health) and time provided on the timer is 50 starting with 3 large bubbles.
If the time limit of level expires or health becomes zero,player loses and has to start over.
If the player managed to clear all bubble,player wins the level and moves ahead.
All the best!
